# Basic Gameplay Elements

## Aly-an
The character of the player
- can carry items
- has HP/energy levels
- can learn skills
	- what the skill is
	- the effectiveness of the skill - strength or stamina
	- the reliability of the skill - success rate of fluency level (like for languages)
- can have pets
	- have name, type of animal, age, gender
	- skill levels - can be increased through training
	- skills - fighting, scouting, fighting, transporting - depends on the type of animal - skills are unlocked as a pet's ages or is trained


Pet Example: A pet Dragon will learn the skills fighting and fire breathing when it reaches certain ages. If trained, it can learn the skill transporting, so that you can ride your Dragon.

## Planet _[cool planet name here]_

- the planet consists of cities
- each city has a number of locations (buildings, certain roads, a general area, etc) for missions and side-quests
- the location of a mission or side-quest becomes neutral ground after the mission or side-quest is fully completed
- a city consists of buildings which can be entered and natives which mill about and can be interacted with (buying from, talking about weather, etc)
- natives who become suspicious of Aly-an will follow Aly-an and call the organization, who after some time will react and try to capture Aly-an
- Aly-an explores the planet and performs missions and side-quests like Link in Link's Awakening (2D)

## Transportation
- Walking
- Running
- Climbing
- Swimming
- Using Native Transportation (like busses or taxis)
- Riding a pet
- Flying - a skill gained by age
- Teleportation - teleporters must be self-build and using them must not arouse suspicion of the natives. First Aly-an must find and use the non-portable schematic, later can discover a schematic for a portable teleporter

## Command

Communication between Command and Aly-an is via intergalactic transmitters, and teleportation for when backup is needed.

The idea is that Aly-an needs no tools such as weapons, but some special items could be secure Command Tech.

## Missions

Missions come straight from Command. They are a way for the user to have a goal to work towards. Ideas for missions are:
- learn the native's culture
- take out a particular native
- etc

Missions can lead to the discovery of new skills.

## Side-quests

Side-quests are like missions, but are activated by the user. For example, if Aly-an is being followed, then the tail should be lost or taken out. These could be triggered by Aly-an's location or interaction with Aly-an's surroundings. Ideas for side-quests are:
- Deal with a tail/stalker
- Create a teleporter
- Develop a newly learned skill
- Perform a task for a native for a reward  
  Example: breaking natives out of jail might make those natives more willing to help you for free

## Skills

Aly-an can learn skills by completing missions or side-quests, or over time by growing up. Skills gained by growing up could be things like:
- Flying
- Shapeshifting
- etc

Skills learned by completing missions and side-quests could be:
- Fighting - basic fighting skills are taught in the tutorial, but more advanced fighting, such as new techniques or styles, can be learnt
- Languages
- Taming animals
- Lie detection
- Potion Knowledge
- Science Knowledge
- Cooking Knowledge
- Lock picking
- Stealth
