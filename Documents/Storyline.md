# Storyline

## Stage 1

You are an alien youngster. You and your best friend join the intergalactic forces of your people to become sleeper agents.

```
Gameplay: Tutorial, in the form of training and final exam to become an agent
```

You and your friend graduate and are sent on a lifelong mission stationed on planet _[cool planet name here]_.

While on this planet, you must avoid suspicion at all costs - the planets' native inhabitants cannot know you are among them. There are organizations that are always on the lookout for spies such as yourself. If you do not avoid detection, these organizations will hunt you down and dissect you to learn about your species. If they do, you lose.

```
Gameplay: Avoid suspicion by disguising yourself as a native, learning the skill to shapeshifter into a native, etc.
```

Command assigns you missions - such as fact-finding, improving your skills, or assassinations of certain natives.

```
Gameplay: Missions and other side-quests allow the user to gain experience and learn new skills. Side-quests evolve from scenarios such as "this native is following me; do I run, confront him in an outgoing manner, or lead him to a quiet place for torture?"
```

```
Gameplay: Skills can be almost anything; the ability to speak a certain language, tame animals, fight a certain way, impersonate natives, etc.
```

As the game progresses, you age, and new age-related skills are learnt. These kinds of skills involve the ability to fly or shapeshift. You can improve these skills and ones earned other ways through training.

```
Gameplay: Training increases the effectiveness (strength or stamina) and reliability (success rate) of that skill. You can choose to focus on a few skills or train a little bit of every skill you come across. Skills are meant to be somewhat abundant throughout the game.
```

At anytime in the game, you have the ability to request temporary backup from Command or hire mercenary natives to assist in the completion of missions. Either can be a risky choice. Hiring natives means you have to be extra careful to avoid detection. Requesting backup from Command could cause Command to lose faith/trust in your ability to complete your mission and threaten to replace you. If you have done a side-quest that was against Command orders, then the backup may report you to Command as well, leading to the threat of replacement. If Command does replace you, your replacement would arrive and try to kill you. Having any assistance means there is a higher risk in local authorities detecting you, which may make your mission harder to complete, depending on the mission.

```
Gameplay: The assistance only lasts for a select mission or side-quest. What happens as a result of getting assistance is determined by your past actions, detection levels in the mission/side-quest, who you chose as backup, and what you do directly after. For example, if you refuse to pay the mercenaries or ask the backup to lie on their mission reports, things will go worse for you.
```

Roughly halfway between the start of the mission and adulthood, you and your friend discuss the native's organizations that are hunting you. The organization seems to be aware that you exist and are becoming more of an issue, making it more difficult for you and your partner to avoid suspicion. You and your partner have a discussion.

```
Discussion: Based on previous conversations with your partner, the dialog has different approaches - either way, you need to decide if you and your partner should take out the heads of the organization. If the heads of the organization is gone, then it is likely that the organization will lose momentum and power, however since you are not to interfere with the native's unless told by Command, then this would mean going against Command, for which the penalty is death. Telling Command of this mission would mean admitting that you messed up the mission, as you did not avoid detection. The penalty for this is also death. If you decide not to take out the head of the organization, then it will be harder and harder to avoid detection.
```

```
Decision:
	- locate and neutralize the heads of the organization
	- don't
```

```
Gameplay: If the discussion ends with the decision to take out the head of the organization, then that is the next mission of you and your partner. Also, you now need to avoid the suspicion of Command, so that they do not realize you went against orders. After the mission, the game continues as it had before this mission. If it does not, then the game continues as before, only it is harder and harder to avoid suspicion.
```

You and your partner reach adulthood. You receive an important mission from Command: "Initiate world domination". You and your friend have a discussion.

```
Discussion: Based on previous conversations, one of (you and your partner) believes that you should obey Command, and the other believes that it is wrong and you should go into hiding to avoid Command's death penalty from disobeying direct orders.
```

```
Decision:
	- follow Command's orders
	- go into hiding to avoid Command's death penalty from not obeying Command
```

```
Decision:
	- do what your partner thinks is best
	- do what you think is best and kill your partner to stop them from doing what they think is best
	- do what you think is best but don't kill your partner, for old times' sake
```

```
Gameplay: This decision determines the final goal of the game. This goal is much more "overarching" than the other missions - it will take much longer to achieve. If you follow Command's order, you can try to dominate the world at least two ways: infiltrating the natives hierarchy and working your way to the top, or all-out war. If you do not follow Command's orders, then you must hide from both natives and agents sent from Command to kill you. One ending for this scenario could be to build a rocket ship and leave the planet, or create your own bunker to live out the rest of your days. If you let your partner live, the you must also watch out for them, whether they are sabotaging your mission, or hunting you down to kill you.
```

You continue to age as you work towards your final goal. As you get older, you lose some of your ability to learn new skills, and the effectiveness and reliability of your existing skills start to fade.

```
Gameplay: Skills take more time and resources to learn. Existing skill levels can be maintained by practicing them more often.
```

If you die of old age before achieving your final goal, you lose the game. If you achieve your goal before then, you win.

```
Gameplay: Game over.
```
